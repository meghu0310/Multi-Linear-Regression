# Multi-Linear-Regression
## **Introduction**
Let's get familiarised with the some of the basic terms to be used:

### **What is a Dataset?**
A data set is a collection of numbers or values that relate to a particular subject. For example, the test scores of each student in a particular class is a data set.

### **Define : Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**
Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.

### **Ordinary Least Square (OLS) :**
In statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS) or linear least squares is a method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model.

### **Information on which software I used for this :**
I did this project using Juypter Notebook.

The server is running on Python(Python 3.8.11),Anaconda Distribution.

### **Python Libraries :**
The basic python libraries used here are:-

**-NumPy** : It is the fundamental package for **scientific computing** in Python.
    
**-Pandas** : Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source **data analysis and manipulation tool**, built on                 top of the Python programming language .

**-Scikit-Learn** : It features various **classification, regression and clustering algorithms.**

**-statsmodels** : It is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models.
